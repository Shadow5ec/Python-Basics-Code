# Sample Code
# Here is a sample code
cars = ['subaru','bmw','toyota','benz','audi']

for car in cars:
    if car == 'bmw':
        print(car.upper())

#At the heart of every if statement is an expression that can be evaluated as True or False and is called a conditional test.Python uses the values True and
False to decide whether the code in an if statement should be executed.

# Checking for Inequality
requested_topping = 'mushrooms'
if requested_topping != 'anchovies':
    print("Hold the anchovies")

#Numerical Comparisons
answer = 20
if answer != 42:
    print("That is not the correct answer, please try again!")

# Checking Multiple Conditions, sometimes you might need two conditions to be True to take an action. 
## Using and to Check Multiple Conditions
# And 

>>> age_0 = 22
>>> age_1 = 18
v >>> age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21
False

w >>> age_1 = 22
>>> age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21

# or 
>>> age_0 = 22
>>> age_1 = 18
>>> age_0 >= 21 or age_1 >= 21
True
>>> age_0 = 18
>>> age_0 >= 21 or age_1 >= 21
False 

# Checking Whether a Value Is in a List
>>> requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'onions', 'pineapple']
>>> 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings
True
>>> 'pepperoni' in requested_toppings
False

# Checking Whether a Value Is Not in a List
banned_user = ['paul','isaac','james','logan','joseph']
user = 'alex'

if user not in banned_user:
    print(user.title()+ ", you can post if you wish")

#Boolean Expressions
# A Boolean value is either True or False, just like the value of a conditional expression after it has been evaluated.


#Simplest form of the if statement. 
if conditional_test:
     do some


Using Multiple elif Blocks

age = 12

if age < 4:
    price = 0 
elif age < 18:
    price = 5
elif age < 65:
    price = 10
else:
    price = 5
print("your admission cos is $" + str(price)+".")

#Omitting the else Block

#Testing Multiple Conditions
Sometimes it’s important to check all of the conditions of interest. In this case, you should use a series of simple if statements with no elif or else blocks. 

requeste_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'extra cheese']

if 'mushrooms' in requeste_toppings:
    print("adding mushrooms.")
if 'pepperoni' in requeste_toppings:
    print("Adding pepperoni")
if 'extra cheese' in requeste_toppings:
    print("Adding extra cheese")

This code above would not work properly if we used an if-elif-else block, because the code would stop running after only one test passes.


#Checking for Special Items
requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese']

for requested_topping in requested_toppings:
    print("Adding " + requested_topping)
print("Finished making you pizza")

#if statement inside the for loop 
requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese']

for requested_topping in requested_toppings:
    if requested_topping == 'green peppers':
        print("sorry, we are out of green peppers right now")
    print("Adding " + requested_topping)
print("Finished making you pizza")

#Checking That a List Is Not Empty
requested_toppings = []

if requested_toppings:
    for requested_topping in requested_toppings:
        print("Adding " + requested_topping + ".")
    print("\nFinished making your pizza!")
else:
    print("Are you sure you want a plain pizza? ")


#Using Multiple Lists
available_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'olives', 'green peppers','pepperoni', 'pineapple', 'extra cheese']
requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'french fries', 'extra cheese']
for requested_topping in requested_toppings:
    if requested_topping in available_toppings:
        print("Adding " + requested_topping + ".")
    else:
        print("Sorry, we do not have the " + requested_topping + ".")
print("\nFinished making you pizza")
